### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Systems Engineer with a strong passion for frontend development. I have hands-on experience working with React, Angular, and Node.js, as well as core web technologies like HTML and CSS.

On the backend, Iâ€™ve worked with Java (Spring Boot), .NET, and API development using microservices architecture. Iâ€™m also experienced with relational and non-relational databases including Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Firebase.

I love learning new technologies, and Iâ€™m especially interested in artificial intelligence and its applications.

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m passionate about fitness, healthy living, and football (soccer).

Always curious. Always building. ðŸš€
